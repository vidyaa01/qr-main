## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS  properties


### What I learned

- how to deploy a page on github pages
- properly write file paths
- centering a div
- how to overcome the problem of 10k unstaged changes.


Some of the code I like:
```css
.card{
      width:210px;
      padding: 10px;
      height:350px;
      margin:auto;
      margin-top:15vh;
      background-color: white;
      border-radius: 10px; 
    }
```

### Continued development

- on deployment of page
- writing the file path correctly
- try to make the code as simple as possible
